## *Repository* :
Git manages the set of projects, as they change over time. Git stores this information in data structure called Repository.
Your Project's repository contains all of your project's file and stores each file's revision history.
For user-owned repositories, you can give other people collaborator access so that they can collaborate on your project. 
If a repository is owned by an organization, you can give organization members access permissions to collaborate on your repository.
