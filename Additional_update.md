# Getting Started with Python

###1. How Python uses Indentation to control Flow
“Control flow” in your code is to affect the order in which the code in your program is executed.
Up until this point in the course, you have seen code that executes linearly; for example:

simple code without any "control flow" and code encapsulation

x = 6

y = 23

print("x + y = ", x + y)

print("x - y = ", x - y)

###2. Don't Repeat Yourself
The term "don't repeat yourself" was coined in 1999 by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer. They defined it as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." In software engineering, DRY is the principle of reducing repetition in the code.
